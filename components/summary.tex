\section{Analysis Summary}
A search for the RS Bulk Graviton has been performed in events with a leptonically decaying Z boson and missing transverse momentum, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment in 2016. The hypothesis is examined for the range of graviton mass between 600 and 2500 GeV. The observed data are consistent with expectations from standard model processes. At the confidential level of 95\%, the region of $m_G <800 GeV$ is excluded for the Bulk Graviton model with $\tilde{k}<0.5$ and zero-width assumption. The analysis is repeated considering variations of the bulk graviton model to include a large mass-dependent width. Exclusion limits are provided separately for gluon-gluon fusion and qq annihilation production processes.

\section{Comparason and Future Prospects}
The $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2\ell 2\nu$ search has its advantage comparing to other diboson final state searches in that its background is more controllable considering the large $p_T ^{miss}$ can help suppress Zjet background, which is the dominant background in these searches. Similar diboson searches for the RS Bulk Graviton with various final states based on 2016 CMS full dataset are listed below and compared with this analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2q 2\nu$~\cite{sum_zzqqnn}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4q$~\cite{sum_vv4q}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2q 2\ell$~\cite{sum_zzqqll}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow WW\rightarrow 4q$~\cite{sum_vv4q}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow WW\rightarrow 2ql\nu$~\cite{sum_wwqqln}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow HH\rightarrow 4b$~\cite{sum_hh4b}
\item $G_{bulk}\rightarrow HH\rightarrow 2b 2\tau$~\cite{sum_hh2b2t}
\end{itemize}

The expected and observed upper limits on the resonance cross section at the 95\% confidence level with zero width assumption for these searches are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sum_bulkGlimits}. Good sensitivity of this $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2\ell 2\nu$ search can be seen in the $m_T < 1000 GeV$ region thanks to the controllable backgrounds, and in this region only the $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2q 2\ell$ analysis shows as good upper limits, in which a separate set of signal region selections is designed specifically for the low mass region~\cite{sum_zzqqll}.

However the $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2\ell 2\nu$ channel suffers low statistics issue when it comes to high mass region. With the integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$, very limited data are observed for either signal region data selection or background modeling for $m_T >1000 GeV$. Therefore, this channel is less capable of exploring the region $m_G >2000Ge$ with the 2016 dataset. Nevertheless, considering that for now statistics is the bottleneck of this analysis, it also indicates that with the 2017 and 2018 CMS data becoming available soon and data corresponding to an integrated luminosity 3 times as high will soon be accessible, significant improvement in the result is expected from the $G_{bulk}\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 2\ell 2\nu$ channel.
