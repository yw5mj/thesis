In this chapter, systematic uncertainties in this analysis are discussed. The signal cross section limits are evaluated based on the $m_T$ distributions for data and background, and the corresponding uncertainty propagated from individual sources of systematic uncertainties.
\section{Systematic Uncertainty}
The sources of systematic uncertainty considered includes those in the background modeling, the signal acceptance, and the integrated luminosity.
\subsection{Integrated Luminosity Uncertainty}
The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity measurement is studied by the CMS Lumi POG and the value of 2.5\% is recommended for all the CMS analyses using 2016 data corresponding to 35.9 fb$^-1$ of integrated luminosity of proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. It is applied to all the signal and backgrounds in this analysis, considering MC samples are involved in all the background modeling methods.
